# Pong
This is the code for the pong game I made using Turtle Graphics! There are slight bugs in the game which I will fix in the upcoming versions of the code, but for now this is it! Happy Playing!

There is a slight bug where in if the ball grazes the paddle it would create a series of bounces and increase the speed which would create an unfair opportunity of the player whose paddle it has grazed
It will be fixed in the upcoming versions as I continue to learn more about Python.

But for now it ain't a bug it a feature ;)
